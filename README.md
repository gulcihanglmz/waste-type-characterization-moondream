# Waste Type Characterization

This project is an application that detects waste items in images and classifies them into predefined waste categories using the **Moondream API**.

## Categories
The application classifies waste into four main categories:

- **Cardboard**: cardboard boxes, pizza boxes, juice and milk cartons, etc.
  
- **Glass**: glass bottles, glass jars, glass beverage bottles, etc.
  
- **Metal**: aluminum cans, beverage cans, metal containers, etc.
  
- **Plastic**: plastic bottles, plastic bags, plastic containers, plastic cups, etc.

Each category contains specific subcategories as defined in the script.

## Setup

1. Clone or download this repository.

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
## Set your Moondream API key in the .env file:
Open the .env file.
Update the MOONDREAM_API_KEY variable with your own Moondream API key:
```bash
MOONDREAM_API_KEY="hf_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
```
